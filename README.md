# Space Manager
Space Manager is a web application that allows you to generate customizable interfaces for space management. You can input the width and height of the space you want to manage, and the application generates an interface that allows you to move and check for overlapping elements.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/HichamRB/SpaceManager.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd space-manager
3. Open the HTML file: open index.html
4. Input the width and height of the space you want to manage and click on "Generate small interface" or "Generate large interface".

# Usage
Once you have generated an interface, you can:

* Move an element by clicking and dragging it.
* Check for overlapping elements by moving an element close to another one. If they overlap, the background of the element turns green , if small interfaces overlaps with each other the background of the element turns yellow .
* Download an image of the interface by clicking on the "Download Image" button.
